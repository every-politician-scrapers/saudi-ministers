He is \"probably the only leader in the Arab world who knows anything about Islamic epistemology and jurisprudence\", according to (secular) scholar of Islamic law Bernard Haykel. In a interview televised in Saudi Arabia on 25 April 2021, bin Salman criticised the devotion of Saudi religious leaders to Wahhabi doctrines \"in language never before used by a Saudi monarch\", saying \"there are no fixed schools of thought and there is no infallible person\", and that fatwas \"should be based on the time, place and mindset in which they are issued\", rather than regarded as immutable.",
